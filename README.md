# ScrollMaster
A(nother) scrolling solution for the Logitech Trackman Marble.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to serve as a template for those that are interested in using global keyboard/mouse hooks to replace scrolling functionality for their Trackman Marble.  Because of that limited initial scope, an effort was made to fully comment the important areas of code so that this can be ported to fit new use cases.  Think of this as a transparent template that can be used to write your own custom scrolling solution.

# Future Plans
At this time, there are no major enhancements planned.  Aside from any bug/best practice code fixes, the current project meets the goals of being minimal and providing a fit-for-purpose solution.
